[![Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/aisichenko/gdsfactory-workshop-ucsb)

August 24, 2023 in Henley Hall, UCSB

We are really excited to offer our first hands-on workshop as part of the Photonics Society. Thomas Dorch from Freedom Photonics and myself will present about gdsfactory. Last year we had a seminar by Joaquin Matres, the maintainer of gdsfactory - you can access the video recording [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BgVfKytcB4). This workshop we'd like to make this session hands on, so please bring your laptops, chargers, and questions about photonics layout. 

Things to do before the workshop

1. Install anaconda python 3 on your computer. If you don't have it installed, the links below are for miniconda, a "lightweight" version of anaconda. Windows: [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QSFsXPuk6mxdzeQODeS05r9z_irvCWei/view?usp=sharing). Mac: [link](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) (select if Intel or M1).
2. Download a Python IDE. Either Visual Studio Code or Pycharm. Personally I prefer [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
3. [Download klayout](https://www.klayout.de/build.html). Windows: [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tlt6L-N6gBrXdL-oOzk-Xr6u5GINnUiT/view?usp=drive_link). Mac: [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1v42hDUQMeR0V3f9i-IJ2w1mKoyX8jX7v/view?usp=sharing) (works on M1 mac, Ventura 13.4).

We will be running the tutorial using python notebooks (.ipynb). These can be run through JupyterLab, VS code (install [this](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=congyiwu.vscode-jupytext) extension), or through Google Colab. You have the option to skip all the steps above and run the notebooks entirely in Google Colab (but with some limitations in klayout integration). You can try it out using this notebooks in this repository, focused on `workshop_part1.ipynb`. In Google Drive you should have the option to select "open with Google Colaboratory"
